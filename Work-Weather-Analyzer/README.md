## Description

This is a project using React.js that I created with my background of the construction industry in mind. [https://mattv-nl.github.io/Work-Weather-Analyzer/](https://github.com/MattV-NL/Work-Weather-Analyzer)

This project will allow a user to enter information regarding the work they have in their work scope. The app will then display the information in charts and tables for the user to see. The weather information is retreived from an API based on the users location. I plan to implement a inp[ut in the future for the user to enter in their desired location to get the weather information for.

A user can see the details of the work information they entered by clicking on the cell in the table of the data they want to inspect.

There is also a feature that if there is a certain degree of weather on the same day as there is work scheduled with the given parameters then in the navigatation bar there is a display message of "Schedule conflict" or "No Schedule Conflict".

## Motivation

I chose to build this project as I was working throughout the winter outside in the elements. Often we would be caught working out in snow storms and have work inside on days with calmer weather. So I thought that I the person planning the workscope had an easy way to see if there was weather during days when work was to be scheduled outside then perhaps that person could reevaluate the work scope and possibly rescedule the work on another day.

## Running the App

this project is not running quite yet as I am working on building the back end as well. I will update when that is complete.

this is a test2
