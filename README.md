# Workster-Server

This is the back end portion of one of my projects, it was built using Express.js. The front end can be found here https://github.com/MattV-NL/Workster-Client.

## Functionality
This backend handles all the communication betweent he front end and the weather API as well as the database. The database can store the users login information, the saved locations, work information related to a particular locations, as well as the users saved settings.

Some of the settings the user can manipulate are the units the weather API uses and the parameters for the conflict feature to allow the user to pick which weather they are okay working in.

## Motivation
I chose to build this project as I was working throughout the winter outside in the elements. Often we would be caught working out in snow storms and have work inside on days with calmer weather. So I thought that I the person planning the workscope had an easy way to see if there was weather during days when work was to be scheduled outside then perhaps that person could reevaluate the work scope and possibly rescedule the work on another day.

## Deployment
I deployed the app myself using a linode VM.
This project is live at https://workster.app/
